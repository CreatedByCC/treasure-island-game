# 🏝️ Treasure Island Game

A text-based adventure game built in Python as part of Day 3 of the **100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp**. The player makes choices to find hidden treasure — but danger lurks at every turn!

## 💡 What I Learned
- Conditional logic (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Handling user input
- Writing interactive command-line programs

## 🚀 How to Play
Run `main.py` in a Python environment and follow the prompts. Choose wisely!

## 📚 Credits
Inspired by the 100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu.
